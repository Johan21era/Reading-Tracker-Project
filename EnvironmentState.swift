//  EnvironmentState.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//
//  Environment Engine — Phase B (Part 5.1 of the build spec)
//
//  The complete, centrally-computed visual state of the application at a
//  single instant. Every view in the Environment/Star/ShootingStar/Weather
//  systems reads its visual properties from an EnvironmentState value —
//  nothing computes its own color, opacity, or intensity independently
//  ("nothing renders its own opinion," Part 4).
//
//  This is a plain value type, not the engine itself. EnvironmentEngine
//  (ObservableObject) owns the *computation* of this value over time;
//  EnvironmentState is just the computed snapshot.
