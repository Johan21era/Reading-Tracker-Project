## What this document is

This is a map of every file and folder in the project, organized so you can find your way around without needing to know how to code.

**Think of it like a building directory:** the top level is the project folder itself; inside are folders for documentation, the actual app code, tests, and the Xcode project settings.

---

## The top level (what you see when you open the project folder)

| Folder / file | What it is |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | The front door — start here |
| `docs/` | All project documentation (registers, roadmap, audit, history, the Mirage integration campaign, etc.) |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | The one-hop lookup: a question maps to the exact file (and line) that owns it |
| `RT_Mirage_Codebase_Merge_Playbook.md` | Owner's kept snapshot of the merge playbook (tracked canon: `docs/integration/` — ignored here by `.gitignore`) |
| `merge-log.md` | Owner's kept snapshot of the campaign log (tracked canon: `docs/integration/merge-log.md` — ignored here by `.gitignore`) |
| `AsterismaV2.0/` | The actual app code — every Swift file that makes the app work |
| `AsterismaV2.0Tests/` | Automated tests that prove the app works correctly |
| `AsterismaV2.0UITests/` | User-interface tests (mostly placeholder stubs) |
| `AsterismaV2.0.xcodeproj/` | The Xcode project file (do not edit by hand) |
| `AsterismaV2.0.entitlements` | Permissions the app asks macOS for (sandbox, user-selected files, location) |
| `AsterismaV2.0-Info.plist` | App settings such as its name, icon, and location description |
| `scripts/` | Census, benchmark, test-isolation, runtime staging, icon, release-package, 3D-graph build (`build-graph-3d.py` + vendored renderer), the cold-retrieval harness (`comprehension-bench.py` + its question bank), the Markdown evidence collector (`audit-markdown.py`), and the stable build-and-launch command (`run-latest.sh`) |
| `dist/` | Generated release packages (gitignored, rebuilt by `scripts/package-release.sh`); the stale local build was removed on 2026-10-28 |
| `.mirage-runtime/` | Local staged Mirage runtime (gitignored; required for a fresh build) |
| `graphify-out/` | Generated knowledge graph, 2D community HTML, offline full-node 3D HTML, and report. The current graph is **8,156 nodes / 20,371 edges / 389 communities**; counts, sizes, and hashes are in the Stage AI close-out receipt in `docs/registers/03-fix-log.md`. `graph-3d-full.html` is the only 3D export — `graph-3d.html` was retired 2026-10-29 |
| `.gitignore` | Tells Git which files to ignore (build junk, user settings, etc.) |
| `.graphifyignore` | Tells graphify to skip `scripts/vendor/` — the minified 3D renderer — so graph counts describe project code and docs |

## The app code (`AsterismaV2.0/`)

This folder contains every Swift file that makes the app run. They are grouped by what they do:

| Group | Contains |
|---|---|
| `App/` | App composition: the `@main` entry point, the four-destination shell (`AppSection`), Quick Open (`CommandPalette`), and the main window (`NewContentView`) |
| `Core/` | The heart of the app: the data store, book models, validators, persistence, and `Sentinel/` (v2 domain, runtime, journal, probe catalog, repairs; `SentinelEngine` is the legacy Debug-console engine) |
| `Engines/` | The "accountants": analytics, estimation, data maturity, insights |
| `Features/` | Everything the user sees and touches: `Home/` (resume-first reading desk), `Library/` (unified browser, filters, selected-book dock), books, reader, goals, `Environment/` (10 s palette engine, continuous atmosphere, stars, shooting stars, live weather layer), weather, audio, achievements, onboarding, reports, RSVP speed-reading, `Sentinel/` (sidebar Health Center, launch card, view model), `DeveloperConsole/` (sidebar search, Environment Studio, Subsystem Explorer, dashboard, Sentinel pane, Demo Profile Lab) — and `Mirage/` (17 typed files: the RT-side of the Mirage integration — wire types, client, sidecar supervisor, runtime locator, cursor gate, status surface, settings, identity map, import flow, sheet, mount, transport, child-process, protocol constants, plus the ADR-13 warm service `MirageEngineService.swift`, cached `MirageLibraryIndex.swift`, and `MirageBatchAnalyzer.swift`) |
| `Assets.xcassets` | Pictures, colors, and icons used in the app |

---

## The tests (`AsterismaV2.0Tests/` and `AsterismaV2.0UITests/`)

These are automated checks that run without you having to click anything. Each test is named after the specific bug or behavior it guards. If a test ever starts failing, that is an early warning that something broke.

As of 2026-10-29: **72 Swift files** in the unit-test folder and **464 tests in 94 suites**. The post-UI-overhaul local unit census (`./scripts/census.sh --unit-only`, exit 0) records **464 tests / 671 runs / 455 passed / 9 skipped / 0 failed** under `AsterismaV2.0`, including the 12 ADR-13 pins in `MirageEngineServiceTests`, `MirageLibraryIndexTests`, and `MirageBatchAnalyzerTests`, and the five environment pins in `EnvironmentWeatherVisualTests`. The older UI-inclusive count (450 tests / 673 runs / 441 passed / 9 skipped / 0 failed) is historical and was not re-run for this working tree. The target remains grouped by responsibility (`App`, `Behavior`, `Core`, `DeveloperConsole`, `Environment`, `Library`, `Mirage`, `Reader`, plus Sentinel domain/runtime/catalog/persistence suites). UI tests remain placeholder launch stubs and are not part of the deterministic merge receipt. See `docs/method/07-testing-strategy.md` for how to engage them.

## How to use this map

- **If you want to fix a bug:** Start with `02-defect-register.md`, find the item you want to work on, then use this map to locate the relevant source file.
- **If you want to understand how a feature works:** Find the feature group in `Features/` and open the file with the same name.
- **If you are lost:** Come back to this file, or start over at `README.md`.
