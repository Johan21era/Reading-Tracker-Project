//
//  DEVELOPER CONSOLE — Phase 1 (Foundation)
//
//  PURPOSE
//  Shared vocabulary for the Developer Console. Every other console file, and
//  every subsystem that reports into the console, uses these three types:
//
//    ConsoleSubsystemCategory  — what KIND of thing this is (manager, service, etc.)
//    ConsoleSubsystemStatus    — the current health, one of exactly 7 states
//    ConsoleSubsystemIdentity  — a stable "name tag" for a subsystem
//    ConsoleSubsystemSnapshot  — one read-only report card for a subsystem, at a moment in time
//
//  This file has ZERO knowledge of any specific subsystem (DataStore,
//  WeatherKitService, etc.). It only defines the shape those subsystems fill
//  in about themselves. That is what keeps the console from needing to be
//  edited every time a new subsystem is added — see DeveloperConsoleObservable.swift.
//
//  This whole file compiles out of Release builds. See the Developer Console
//  section of handoff.md for why #if DEBUG is the right gate for this project
//  (verified against this project's own build settings, not assumed).
//

/// message, a timestamp) — nothing here is a synthesized/derived number like

/// belong to later phases and must follow the Derived Metrics Protocol
/// before they exist; Phase 1/2 deliberately stay direct-passthrough only.
