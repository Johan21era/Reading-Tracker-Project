//  EPUBPackage.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//  Added as part of the EPUBReaderScreen architectural redesign.
//  See EPUB_READER_REDESIGN_PLAN.txt for the plan this implements.
//  Responsibility: open an EPUB archive exactly once per reading session,
//  keep it open (security scope + unzipped temp directory) for as long as
//  the caller needs it, hand out per-chapter file URLs on demand, and
//  guarantee the security scope and temp directory are released exactly
//  once no matter how the session ends (success, thrown error, or Task
//  cancellation mid-open). This replaces EPUBReaderScreen's previous
//  "unzip, grab a fixed text snippet, delete everything" one-shot flow.
//
//  This type has no SwiftUI/View dependency — it is pure Foundation/XML
//  resource management, usable independently of how it's displayed.
