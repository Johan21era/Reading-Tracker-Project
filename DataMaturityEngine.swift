// DataMaturityEngine.swift
//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  MARK: - What this file is

//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  DataMaturityEngine is an authority layer, not an analysis layer.
//
//  Every other engine in this app (BehaviorContextEngine, WeatherAnalysisEngine,
//  InsightEngine, IntelligentNotificationEngine, MusicalAnalysisEngine, ...)
//  is free to keep computing correlations, scores, and confidence numbers
//  exactly as it always has. DataMaturityEngine does not touch any of that.
//
//  What it owns is the question that sits between "we noticed a pattern" and
//  "we told the user about it":
//
//      canWeSayThis() -> MaturityVerdict
//
//  It never:
//    - collects data
//    - modifies collected data
//    - changes analytics, session generation, or metrics
//    - changes persistence
//    - changes correlation calculations
//
//  It only decides, for a proposed claim:
//    - whether the claim may reach the UI at all (ClaimDecision / ClaimDisposition)
//    - the confidence ceiling it is allowed to carry (allowedConfidence)
//    - how strongly it may be worded (narrativeStrength)
//    - why (rationale — a plain-English audit trail)
//
//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  MARK: - Why evidence, never time

//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  Nothing in this file reads Date() and asks "how long has this account
//  existed" or "how many days since install." The only dates this engine
//  ever looks at are the timestamps ON THE EVIDENCE ITSELF — the oldest and
//  newest observations that support or contradict a claim, supplied fresh
//  by the caller every time. A user who reads compulsively for one very
//  long day produces a huge sample count but a near-zero observed span,
//  and this engine will correctly refuse to call that a "stable pattern."
//  A user who reads modestly across ninety calendar days builds span
//  whether or not the app was installed nine months ago. Maturity here is
//  a property of the evidence, not the clock.
//
//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  MARK: - Why this file is domain-agnostic

//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  BehaviorContextEngine's narratives, InsightEngine's ReadingInsight cards,
//  WeatherAnalysisEngine's EnvironmentalCorrelation rows, and
//  IntelligentNotificationEngine's NotificationCandidate messages all have
//  completely different shapes. Rather than teach DataMaturityEngine about
//  four different vocabularies, every caller translates its own evidence
//  into one shared currency — MaturityEvidenceDigest — via small adapters
//  (see DataMaturityEngineAdapters.swift). This file never imports or
//  references Book, ReadingSession, WeatherSnapshot, or any other
//  app-domain type. That separation is what lets the same engine govern
//  every claim-producing system in the app without becoming a giant
//  switch statement keyed on "which engine called me."
//
//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  MARK: - Composition over one big switch

//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  Two things in this app are the "correct" answer for different reasons,
//  and both are implemented as ordered lists of small, independently
//  testable units rather than as one large conditional:
//
//    1. Scoring: a battery of `MaturityEvaluating` evaluators, each
//       responsible for exactly one evidentiary question (volume, recency,
//       consistency, contradiction, replication, historical depth, trend
//       stability, cross-domain corroboration). Adding a new evaluator
//       never requires touching the others.
//
//    2. Deciding: an ordered list of `ClaimRule`s, each a small pure
//       function that either returns a decision or defers to the next
//       rule. Adding a new decision path means adding a new rule, not
//       editing a switch statement that everything else also depends on.
//
//  ClaimDecision and NarrativeStrengthTier are themselves open, extensible
//  value types (string-identified, not closed enums) so new decision
//  kinds or new wording tiers can be introduced later without recompiling
//  every switch that touches them.
//
