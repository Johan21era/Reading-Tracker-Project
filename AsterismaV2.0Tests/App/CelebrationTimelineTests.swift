//  Defect class being pinned: the old overlay chained Timer→Task→Timer with a
//  cleanup() that could only invalidate whichever Timers existed *at its instant*;
//  dismissal landing between one timer firing and its Task hop orphaned the next
//  phase (and eventually a repeating particle timer) on a dead view. The extracted
//  CelebrationTimeline makes that race deterministically testable: an injected
//  sleeper that "dismisses" mid-sequence must provably silence every later step.
