//  The four named anchor periods in the Environment Engine's 24-hour cycle.
//  Night and Midday are described in the brief as points the system settles
//  at or briefly crosses rather than periods with their own internal
//  evolution — see the design note in EnvironmentPalette.keyframeTrack for
//  how that's represented without any special-cased branching.

/// Converts wall-clock time into fractional minutes-since-midnight — the
/// unit `EnvironmentPalette.keyframeTrack` is indexed by. Kept fractional
/// (not rounded to whole minutes) so the eased interpolation is smooth even
/// though the engine only recomputes every 30-60s (Part 5.3): each tick
/// still lands at the precise "now," it just doesn't tick every frame.
///
/// This is the ONLY place in the Environment Engine that touches `Date()`
/// directly — every view reads `EnvironmentState`, never the wall clock, per
/// Part 5.1's explicit rule (verifiable by grepping this feature for
/// `Date()` once Phase B-E is complete: this file is the only hit besides
/// EnvironmentEngine's own `now: () -> Date` injection point).
