//  WeatherEnvironmentModifier.swift
//  Environment Engine — Phase E (Part 8 of the build spec)
//
//  The two, and only two, weather-driven adjustments Part 8 permits: a small
//  atmospheric-opacity/desaturation nudge from cloud cover, and a night-only
//  star-visibility reduction from cloud cover. No rain, lightning, or storm
//  visuals — this is two knobs on the existing Environment Engine, not a
//  second effect system, per Part 8's explicit warning.
//
//  VERIFIED (Phase A): WeatherKitService.shared.snapshots(from:to:) —
//    WeatherKitService.swift:159-164
//    `@MainActor public func snapshots(from startDate: Date, to endDate: Date) throws -> [WeatherSnapshot]`
//    Synchronous, throwing, queries only already-persisted local SQLite data
//    (WeatherSnapshotStore.fetchRange) — no network call, no session write.
//    Existing precedent: WeatherInsightPanel 2.swift:313, `try WeatherKitService.shared.snapshots(from:...)`.
//  Deliberately NOT using snapshotForCurrentConditions(sessionID:)
//    (WeatherKitService.swift:61-82): that method does a live WeatherKit
//    network fetch AND writes a row to the session-attached SQLite store —
//    wrong semantics (there is no reading session here) and unsafe to call
//    every ~45s from an ambient background system.
//  VERIFIED (Phase A): WeatherSnapshot's real fields, from its own
//    test-target constructor calls (WeatherKitService.swift:1220, 1342):
//    `timestamp: Date`, `cloudCover: Double`, plus fields this file doesn't need.
