//  SpatialLibraryView 2.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//  Spatial Library — Phase F/G/H entry point (Part 9.1, 9.2 of the build spec)
//
//  Operates on whatever [Book] it's given — it does not know or care
//  whether that array is the full library or an already-filtered subset.
//  Progressive Filtering (Part 10 / Phase I) doesn't exist yet; per Part
//  9.1's pipeline order ("Filtering always happens first and produces a
//  subset. Layout and navigation only ever operate on that already-filtered
//  subset"), this view IS the layout+navigation half of that pipeline, and
//  is agnostic to how its input was produced. Whoever wires this in later
//  is responsible for filtering first.
//
//  The tier cross-fade below is built now, ahead of Part 10 actually
//  existing, specifically so that once real filtering starts changing
//  `books.count` across tier boundaries, it already animates smoothly per
//  Part 10's own requirement ("This transition between tiers should itself
//  be a smooth cross-fade/settle, not an abrupt layout swap") instead of
//  needing to be retrofitted later.
