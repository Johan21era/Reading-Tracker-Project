//  MARK: - What this file is

//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  DataMaturityEngine.swift is deliberately domain-agnostic — it has never
//  heard of a Book, a ReadingSession, or a CitedContextNarrative. This file
//  is the glue: it teaches four existing, already-live pipelines how to
//  translate their own evidence into MaturityEvidenceDigest, ask
//  canWeSayThis(), and act on the answer.
//
//  Four call sites are wired end to end here, because these are the four
//  places a proposed behavioral claim is actually reachable by the user
//  today:
//
//    1. BehaviorContextEngine  — buildNarratives() (V1, live, feeds
//       ContextInsightPanel via @Published summary) and
//       ExplainabilityNarrativeBuilder.build() (V3, richer, currently
//       unreferenced by any View but wired here so it is gate-correct
//       the moment something calls analyzeWithIntelligence()).
//    2. InsightEngine.generateAll()            — feeds ReadingInsightsDashboard.
//    3. WeatherAnalysisEngine.analyzeCorrelations() — feeds WeatherInsightPanel.
//    4. IntelligentNotificationEngine candidates — feeds NotificationScheduler,
//       i.e. an actual push notification the user sees.
//
//  Three more claim-shaped surfaces exist in the codebase
//  (AnnualReportGenerator.ReaderNarrativeProfile / AudioAnnualReport,
//  PredictiveRecommendationEngine's book ranking, AchievementEngine's
//  milestones) and are intentionally NOT wired here. See
//  "Session Concept 1.md" for why each was deferred rather than rushed.
//
//  Every adapter in this file follows the same shape: read whatever real
//  counts/dates the source engine already has lying around, build a
//  MaturityEvidenceDigest from them (never inventing evidence, never
//  reading Date() for anything but "now"), ask the shared engine instance
//  below, and let the verdict decide inclusion/wording — never the other
//  way around.
