//  The single place subsystems register themselves and the Dashboard reads
//  from. This file is the only piece of "glue" in the whole console — and
//  even it never lists a specific subsystem by name for the instance-based
//  case. (The static-engine case has one small, explicit, documented
//  exception — see DeveloperConsoleObservable.swift and the manifest below.)
