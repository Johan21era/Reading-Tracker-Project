//  BookVisualState.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//  Spatial Library — Phase F (Part 9.3 of the build spec)
//
//  The Navigation Model's hard rule: every visible book has a set of VISUAL
//  properties only — position, rotation, depth, scale, opacity, focus state
//  — held separately from the underlying Book data. Navigating modifies
//  ONLY this struct. Book itself (Book 2.swift) is never touched by
//  anything in this feature — every tier view only ever reads `book.*`
//  properties, never assigns to them.
