//
//  ShootingStarManager.swift
//  Environment Engine — Phase D (Part 7 of the build spec)
//
//  Periodically decides whether to spawn a shooting star: randomized
//  45-120s evaluation interval, ~15-25% spawn chance per evaluation, never
//  more than one active at a time, and only evaluated at all when
//  starVisibility is high enough that one would be visible ("there is no
//  reason to run this system at noon" — Part 7).
//
//  ObservableObject + @MainActor, matching the same house convention
//  confirmed for EnvironmentEngine (and WeatherKitService itself).
