import Foundation

// PR-5 app glue: bridges RT's Book (owned data) into the Mirage import flow,
// borrowing ONLY read-only referents (`Book.resolveURL()`) — it never creates
// books, never touches goals, and never writes RT's own store (ADR-6 census
// gate; the RT-side NEW-DE-5 bypass stays path-independent by construction).
//
// Engine-location policy is DEV-OPT-IN for PR-5: the same MIRAGE_REAL_ENGINE_DIR
// environment variable the opt-in test suites use. No hardcoded paths, no
// production semantics — the packaged-runtime policy belongs to ADR-3 / PR-8
// and will replace this lookup wholesale.
//
// Lifecycle doctrine (2026-10-29): ONE warm sidecar serves every Mirage
// operation in the app session, serialized by MirageEngineService. The older
// spawn-import-shutdown-per-gesture rule is retired by ADR-13; the M-027
// root-cause campaign proved the machinery boundary it guarded was not present
// under the production path. A dead child is still re-handshaken lazily, and
// `shutdown()` remains the only teardown door.

/// The app-level service needs exactly this much of a session: a serialized
/// client door, the shared identity stratum, a terminal-state reset, and a
/// clean shutdown. Tests inject a fake to prove service behavior without a
/// process spawn.
