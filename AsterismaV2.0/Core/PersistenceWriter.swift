//  PersistenceWriter.swift
//  AsterismaV2.0
//
//  FINAL TRACES / UPGRADE #4 (safe slice): a dedicated OWNED serial queue
//  that executes ALL library disk writes. Replaces the ad-hoc detached-task
//  chain in DataStore.enqueueWrite — identical FIFO ordering contract, but
//  the executor is owned and named, so future SQLite-style stores can adopt
//  it directly (fixes the cross-thread handle issue from P6-G: everything
//  touching a DB handle will run on THIS queue).
//
//  Why DispatchQueue over an actor here: encode/write closures are
//  synchronous by nature; a serial queue gives owned serialization without
//  async-entry friction at every call site, and plays perfectly with the
//  semaphore drain in saveImmediately().
