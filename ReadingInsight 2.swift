//  InsightEngine.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//
//  PURPOSE
//  Generates human-readable, actionable insights from analytics data.
//  Transforms raw numbers into narrative cards the user can act on.
//
//  RATIONALE
//  AnalyticsEngine produces values. InsightEngine produces meaning.
//  A user seeing "avg 47s/page" doesn't know if that's fast or slow.
//  An insight saying "You read 20% faster in the morning — try scheduling
//  your sessions before noon" is immediately actionable.
//
//  Without InsightEngine, the analytics surface is data-dumping.
//  With it, the app becomes a reading coach.
//
//  DESIGN
//  • Insights are declarative ReadingInsight structs with a kind, title,
//    body, actionSuggestion, and confidence level.
//  • The engine generates insights from all available analytics dimensions:
//    time-of-day, trend, difficulty, streak, peer-comparison (same genre),
//    goal progress, improvement trajectory, and prediction reliability.
//  • Insights are filtered by confidence threshold before display so the UI
//    never shows low-confidence noise.
//  • All insight generation is pure (no state, no side effects).
//
//  CALLERS
//    • Stats/insights UI views — display insight cards
//    • ReadingGoalManager — augments with goal-specific insights
//    • AchievementEngine — cross-references for motivational messaging
//
//  INTERACTIONS
//    • Reads AnalyticsEngine (all subsystems)
//    • Reads ReadingGoalManager for goal context
//    • Reads SharedTextUtilities.ReadingComplexityHints for difficulty signals
