//  Environment Engine — Phase B (Part 5 of the build spec)

//  SwiftUI's `Color` doesn't expose its RGBA components in a form that's
//  safe to linearly interpolate across arbitrary color spaces, so the
//  Environment Engine stores and blends its own RGBA components and only
//  converts to `Color` at the point of rendering.
