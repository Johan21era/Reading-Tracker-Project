//  LibraryExplorerView2.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//
//  Created by Johan Rembeci on 7/13/26.
//
//
//  LibraryExplorerView.swift
//  Reading Tracker
//
//  Progressive Filtering — Phase I entry point (Part 9.1, Part 10 of the build spec)
//
//  Enforces Part 9.1's pipeline order in one place: filtering happens
//  first and produces a subset; SpatialLibraryView (Phase F/G/H) only ever
//  operates on that already-filtered subset, never on `allBooks` directly.
//  Selecting a filter that drops the subset across a tier threshold (e.g.
//  16 books down to 4) is handled automatically — SpatialLibraryView's own
//  cross-fade, built in Phase F specifically for this moment, takes care of
//  it without anything new here.
//
//  Uses NavigationSplitView (not HSplitView) to match the root ContentView's
//  own navigation paradigm (NewContentView.swift), confirmed in Phase A —
//  same reasoning as matching the house ObservableObject convention earlier
//  in this project: consistency with what's already there over introducing
//  a second pattern for the same job.
//
//  Not yet wired into NewContentView.swift itself — that's still Phase K,
//  same as the Environment Engine's background view and the Spatial
//  Library before it. This view is self-contained and ready for it.
