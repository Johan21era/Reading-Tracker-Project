//  DataStore registers itself here at init; the engine reads through this so
//  the engine itself stays decoupled from SwiftUI/App lifecycle ownership.
//
//  SECURITY NOTE (S1): this is a READ bridge. It exposes only what probes
//  need; mutations always go through DataStore's own audited public APIs.
